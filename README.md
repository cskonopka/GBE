generativeEnvelope
==================

generative breakpoint envelope for audio plug-ins/software

The purpose of this plug-in is to give the user the ability to create their own envelope to be applied to an audio plug-in parameter or Session View parameter. An envelope can be created manually by adding breakpoints individually or by using the restart feature which generates random breakpoints.
