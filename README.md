![Max-for-Live](http://christopherkonopka.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/github-m4L-generativeEnvelope.png)

The purpose of this plug-in is to give the user the ability to create their own envelope to be applied to an audio plug-in parameter or Session View parameter. An envelope can be created manually by adding breakpoints individually or by using the restart feature which generates random breakpoints. 

**envelopeSize**
the maximum value of the x-axis

**readTime**
the speed at which the envelope is read

**restartTime**
the amount of time it takes to re-trigger the envelope

**add point**
manually add a generative point

**trigger**
trigger the envelope

**clear**
clear the envelope

**loop new pts**
when enabled with restart time ON, each time the loop is restarted, a new generative breakpoint will be added.

**curve resolution**
this is the resolution of randomness that generates new breakpoints
