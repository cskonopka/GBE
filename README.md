- *envelopeSize*: The size of the envelope
- *readTime*: The speed of the envelope
- *add new dot*: - Randomly add a new point to the breakpoint envelope
- *loop*: - Loop the current breakpoint envelope
- *gen dots*: - Generate new points each time the envelope is looped.
- *retrigTime*: - The time it takes to retrigger the envelope.
